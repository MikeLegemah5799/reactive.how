## Episode 4 - Time projection

With the first three episodes, you have learned three concepts of Reactive Programming. Congrats!

- 1 - [Streams](/fromEvent)
- 2 - [Immutability](/map)
- 3 - [Reactivity](/listen)

Today, I'm sending you a new card:

{% include card_player.html video=237374630 episode=true %}

Use a `‚ñ¨ number` piece on this card to set the time period, such as `3000` milliseconds. Then, this is how `‚ùö delay` operates:

- It projects each event of an input stream through time
- As a result, it returns a new stream of timeshifted events

As you can see, it doesn't change the relative time intervals between the events.

Two weeks ago, you projected events through a **function** with [map](/map). You now have learned cards can also project events through **time**. Yeah!

Next Monday, we'll play with _two_ input streams üòé.
