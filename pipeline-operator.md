Recently, [Ben Lesh tweeted](https://twitter.com/BenLesh/status/973255406947467264) the importance of the [pipeline operator proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator) in JavaScript. In this episode I show you how it feels to use this operator, especially with RxJS pipeable operators (read [pipeable operators vs. dot-chaining](/rxjs/pipeable-operators-vs-dot-chaining)):

**Try the pipeline operator!** This is what I installed:

* Babel plugin [proposal-pipeline-operator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator) (babel 7 beta)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter, that now supports the pipeline operator by default
* [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font with programming ligatures to have `â–·` instead of `|>`

This episode continues in an RxJS specific article:
<br/>[**RxJS pipeable operators vs. dot-chaining**](/rxjs/pipeable-operators-vs-dot-chaining)

Also, I created animated cards that show how the operators used in this episode work:<br/>[**Episode 2 - map**](/map)<br/>[**Episode 9 - take**](/take)<br/>[**Episode 16 - interval**](/interval)
