In this episode I will use _map_ and _take_. You should watch the related episodes:

> [![](/img/map/icon.png){:.w150}](/map) [![](/img/take/icon.png){:.w250}](/take) <br/> ▶️ [Episode 2 - **map**](/map) &nbsp;▶️ [Episode 9 - **take**](/take)

Today, I show you the pipeline operator proposal in Javascript, in action with RxJS pipeable operators. Links about my configuration are after the video!

> _Recently, [Ben Lesh tweeted](https://twitter.com/BenLesh/status/973255406947467264) the importance of the [pipeline operator proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator) in JavaScript._

**Try the pipeline operator!** This is what I installed:

* Babel plugin [proposal-pipeline-operator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator) (babel 7 beta)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter, that now supports the pipeline operator by default
* [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font with programming ligatures to have `▷` instead of `|>`

> <small>🎨 In the [previous episode](/max), I used the [Gloom theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adamgirton.gloom) port for VS Code. But it doesn't work with ▷ the ligature. Instead, in today's demo, I used the [Hydra theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=juanmnl.vscode-theme-hydra).</small>

**NEW 🔥** Try [RxJS Explorer](/rxjs/explorer) to learn more and download the source code of this demo.
