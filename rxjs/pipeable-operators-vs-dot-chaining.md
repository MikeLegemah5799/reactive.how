## RxJS 5.5 and dot-chaining

Prior to RxJS 5.5, you were _dot-chaining_ the operators like this:

```
const stream = Observable.interval(TICK)
  .take(LENGTH)
  .map(gaussian)
```

## RxJS 5.5.\* and pipeable operators

RxJS 5.5 introduced _pipeable operators_ and `pipe`:

```
import { interval } from 'rxjs/observable/interval';
import { take, map } from 'rxjs/operators';

const stream = interval(TICK).pipe(
  take(LENGTH),
  map(gaussian)
)
```

> Read why this is is a better approach:
> <br/> [github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/.../pipeable-operators.md#why](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/pipeable-operators.md#why)

You can now easily build your own operators and chain them with the RxJS ones:

```
// Custom operator based on RxJS map:
const draw = brush =>
  map(num =>
    brush.repeat(Math.floor(num * 65))
  )

const stream = interval(TICK).pipe(
  take(LENGTH),
  map(gaussian),
  draw("â€¢")
)
```

## RxJS 6 beta and rx-compat

RxJS 6 is coming soon. If you have a code base dot-chaining operators, you can still use it thanks to the compatibility package. It adds operators to Observable.prototype and creation methods to Observable:

```
$ npm install rxjs@beta
$ npm install rxjs-compat
```

```
import { Observable } from "rxjs-compat"
```

## The future

### JavaScript |> pipeline operator

There is a [pipeline operator proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator). In particular, it allows you to write your code like this:

```
const draw = brush =>
  map(num =>
    num * 65 |> Math.floor |> brush.repeat
  )

const stream =
  interval(TICK)
  |> take(LENGTH)
  |> map(gaussian)
  |> draw("â€¢")
```
